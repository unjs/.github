- Discuss the issue/idea with the maintainers using an issue BEFORE.
- Please keep your changes minimal and split them if you need to.
- Ensure there is a minimal reproduction attached for bug fixes.
- PR titles should follow conventional commit guidelines. Examples:
  - fix(scope): resolve xyz
  - feat: add a new feature
  - docs: improve wording

This will greatly help speed up the review process.
