# automd snippets

## What is this?

This directory contains UnJS related [automd](https://automd.unjs.io) remote snippets that can be used with [fetch](https://automd.unjs.io/generators/fetch) generator.

**Example:** Add this to the end of your `README.md`:

```md
<!-- automd:fetch url="gh:unjs/.github/main/snippets/readme-footer.md" -->
<!-- /automd -->
```

Now run `npx automd` to see the magic!

## Why the files are empty?

The snippet files only contain `<!-- automd -->` comments. Try to clone or view the source file.
